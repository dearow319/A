> Agent's Plans
---
Creation of Sect:

- Goal: Strengthen their homeland at our expense.
- Timeline: Two years.
- Resources: Everything they could steal from under your nose.

Undermining Vektorian Plans:

- Goal: Redirecting focus and funds.
- Timeline: Three years.
- Methods: Misinformation, conflict... the works.

It’s almost endearing how much they overestimated you.

ACTIONS TAKEN

Neutralization Plan:

- Assassination: Already Done. You’re welcome.
- Memory-Wipe Technology: Advanced measures to erase their (and their country's) existence, the Redknight will not be insulted.

Your little infiltrator will be nothing more than a crushed ant.

Let’s be clear, if I wanted, the Vektotian group would’ve crumbled yesterday. But allowing amateurs like this infiltrator to exploit our Order for their petty ambitions? Unacceptable. I won’t let the sanctity of what we’ve built be tarnished—especially by someone so utterly beneath us.

You may see pawns in the game. I see tools to be used, discarded, and forgotten when they no longer serve a purpose. And you, Viktor? You’re teetering dangerously close to irrelevance.

Conclusion:

The threat has been neutralized. Unlike you, I don’t hesitate when the sanctity of our operations is at stake.

Perhaps it’s time you took better care of your house. Or would you prefer I continue doing your job for you?

Signed,
Your 'best friend' ;)
