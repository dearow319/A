Initial Conditioning:
- Physical Conditioning: Subjects undergo rigorous physical training to build strength, agility, and endurance. This includes exposure to extreme temperatures, deprivation of sleep, and high-intensity physical exercises.
- Psychological Conditioning: Subjects are subjected to intense psychological pressure, including isolation, sensory deprivation, and simulated combat scenarios. The goal is to desensitize them to fear and pain, fostering a state of mental resilience.

Biological Enhancements:
- Genetic Manipulation: Using advanced genetic engineering techniques, we introduce modified DNA sequences to enhance physical attributes such as muscle density, bone strength, and metabolic efficiency.
- Chemical Treatments: Subjects are administered a cocktail of experimental drugs designed to increase pain tolerance, accelerate healing, and enhance cognitive functions.

Experimental Surgeries:
- Enhanced Sensory Organs: Surgical modifications are made to enhance sensory capabilities, such as night vision, heightened hearing, and improved olfactory senses.

Mutilations and Torture:
- Blunt Force Resistance: Subjects are subjected to blunt force trauma to test their durability. This includes being struck with heavy objects, dropped from significant heights, and subjected to explosive blasts.
- Piercing and Slashing Resistance: To assess their vulnerability to sharp objects, subjects are pierced with needles, cut with blades, and subjected to gunshot wounds.
