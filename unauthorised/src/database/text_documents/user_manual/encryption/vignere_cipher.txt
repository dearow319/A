> Vigenère Cipher Encryption
---
Welcome, Operative. The Vigenère Cipher uses a keyword to shift each letter of the plaintext differently. Default key: KEY.

Example:

	Plaintext: APPLE
	Key: KEYKE
	Encrypted: KTLPI

Explanation:

	A (shifted by K=10): K
	
	P (shifted by E=4): T
	
	P (shifted by Y=24): L
	
	L (shifted by K=10): P
	
	E (shifted by E=4): I

To access the next file, congratulations.txt, prove your mastery by encrypting its full filename using the Vigenère Cipher. Ensure you input the result correctly.

'congratulations'.txt

Good luck, Operative.
