> Gagarin Behavior Analysis
---
Since Yuri Gagarin's return from space, there have been significant behavioral changes. He exhibits erratic behavior, mood swings, and displays signs of paranoia and dissociation. Initial assessments indicate that these changes may be linked to his space travel. Detailed observations suggest that Gagarin's mental state has deteriorated significantly, raising concerns about his overall well-being.

Gagarin often appears disoriented and struggles with basic tasks. He frequently mutters to himself and seems unable to focus on or understand conversations. His interactions with colleagues have become increasingly strained, and he often withdraws into silence. Gagarin's handwriting has become illegible and inconsistent.

Further analysis is required to understand the root cause of these changes. We should ask 'Caesar' to 'find' jdjdulq_phglfdo_uhsruw for more details. The middle word of the text will provide the password.
