> ORDER HISTORY: THE REDKNIGHT ORDER
---
Founding and Early History:

The RedKnight Order, originally known as "The Shadow Order," was founded in the late 19th century by a group of influential figures from various European nations. The founders sought to create a secret society that could influence global events from behind the scenes, ensuring stability and order in a rapidly changing world.

Founding Members:

- Sir Reginald Blackwood: A British diplomat and strategist.

- Countess Eliza von Richter: A German industrialist with connections to the military.

- General Andrei Volkov: A Russian military officer with deep ties to the Tsarist regime.

- Dr. Johann Schmidt: A German scientist specializing in advanced technologies.

Early Missions:

	1892: The Order's first major mission was to support the unification of Italy, providing financial and strategic support to key political figures.
	
	1898: The Order played a crucial role in the Spanish-American War, influencing the outcome to ensure a favorable balance of power in Europe.
	
	1905: During the Russo-Japanese War, the Order worked to destabilize Russia internally, paving the way for the eventual rise of the Bolsheviks.

Formation of Sub-Factions

1917: With the fall of the Tsarist regime in Russia, the Order faced a significant internal crisis. The remaining members reorganized and formed two distinct sub-factions:

	The Vektorians: Led by Sir Reginald Blackwood, they believed in maintaining a strong British Empire and a stable Europe.
	
	The BlackStones: Led by Countess Eliza von Richter, they sought to promote the dominance of the United States and diminish the influence of European powers.

Key Events and Operations

1920s: The Vektorians supported the rise of fascist regimes in Europe, seeing them as a bulwark against communism. Meanwhile, the BlackStones worked to strengthen the United States economically and militarily.

1930s: During World War II, both factions played pivotal roles:

	The Vektorians: Provided intelligence and support to the Allies, particularly to the British.
	
	The BlackStones: Covertly supported the United States, ensuring its emergence as a superpower post-war.

1945: Post-WWII, the Vektorians and BlackStones found themselves at odds over the future of global politics. The Vektorians advocated for a strong British-led Europe, while the BlackStones pushed for a U.S.-dominated world order.


Internal Conflicts:

1953: The death of Joseph Stalin threw the Order into disarray. Deep-seated ideological differences came to the surface, leading to a violent split:

	The Vektorians: Aligned with Soviet and British intelligence, believing that a strong British Empire could maintain global stability.
	
	The BlackStones: Formed alliances with American and Soviet defectors, seeing the U.S. as the future of global governance.

1956: The Black Door Project was initiated by both factions, aiming to create superhuman soldiers capable of withstanding extreme physical and psychological stress. This project led to significant ethical concerns and internal strife.
