> Caesar Cipher Encryption
---
Welcome, Operative.

The 'Caesar Cipher' is a simple encryption technique that shifts each character in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphanumeric sequence. In the XCORE system, the shift is '+3'.

Example:

	a becomes d
	Z becomes C
	7 becomes 0

Non-alphanumeric characters remain unchanged.

Operational Notes:

	The shift is always +3 unless specified otherwise.
	Proper usage ensures secure encoding for low-risk operations.

The next file, 'transposition_cipher.txt', explores a more complex method. To access it, encrypt the first word of its name, transposition, using the Caesar Cipher (+3 shift) and enter the result as the password.

Good luck, Operative.
