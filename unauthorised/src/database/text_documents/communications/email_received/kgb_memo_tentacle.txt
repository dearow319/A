Memo:

Subject: Yuri Gagarin

	Observations:
		1. Yuri Gagarin has exhibited highly erratic behavior since his return from space.

		2. On [REDACTED], during a routine check-up, Gagarin's left arm inexplicably morphed into a tentacle-like appendage.

		3. Medical personnel present reported that Gagarin, upon noticing their reactions, immediately manipulated his arm back to its original state.

		4. Further instances of unusual physical transformations have been reported, including changes in skin color and texture.

	Recommendations:
		1. Given the extraordinary nature of these occurrences, immediate action is required.

		2. The Committee is awaiting orders to either eliminate Yuri Gagarin or contain him for further experimentation.

Until further instructions are received, all personnel are advised to maintain strict confidentiality and monitor Gagarin's movements closely. You should find my 'hypothesis_on_gagarin'
