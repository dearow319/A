> Transposition Cipher Encryption
---
Welcome, Operative. The 'Transposition Cipher' rearranges the characters of the plaintext into a new order. Unlike substitution ciphers, it keeps the original characters but changes their positions.

In this system, the plaintext is divided into columns of 4 characters, and any incomplete rows are filled with 'X'. Columns are then read to form the ciphertext.

Example:
To encrypt "admin":

	Divide into columns:

a  d  m  i
n  X  X  X

Read columns:

	an  dX  mX  iX

Ciphertext: 'andXmXiX'

To proceed, decrypt the first word of "vigenere_cipher.txt" using this method (without keys) to uncover the password.

Stay sharp, Operative.
