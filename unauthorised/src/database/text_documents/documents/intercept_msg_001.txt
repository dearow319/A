Well, well… looks like ▙█▊▔▎░ has roped in another “loyal soul” to do his bidding. The man just can’t get enough of those ominous, hollow speeches, can he? You’d think he’d tire of the theatrics, but no—he’s a clown with a captive audience. Welcome to the puppet show, where you’re both the puppet *and* the master… if you play your cards right.

A word of caution: ▙█▊▔▎░ speaks of loyalty, but here? Loyalty’s about as durable as glass. Everyone has an angle, a hidden game they play. I suggest you find yours sooner than later if you plan to survive. Make the right choice, and you might just evade certain *unfortunate consequences.*

Oh, and don’t flatter yourself. If you’re seeing this, it’s because I wanted you to.
