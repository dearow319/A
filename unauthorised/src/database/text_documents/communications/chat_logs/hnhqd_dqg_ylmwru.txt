▙█▊▔▎ ░:
Unbelievable. You truly are delusional, aren’t you? A cowardly, pathetic parasite. Willing to lie and deceive everyone for a worthless illusion of power.

▄▋▄▍▀:
Keep talking, ▙█▊▔▎ ░. Your moral superiority is nauseating.

▙█▊▔▎ ░:
What do you even understand about honor, ▄▋▄▍▀? You’ve sold your soul for a chance to be a 'puppet master' behind the scenes.

▄▋▄▍▀:
Better to pull the strings than to be pulled by weak-minded fools like you. At least I’m playing the game right.

▙█▊▔▎ ░:
The game? Is that what this is? What, so you can feed your ego with lies? You’d sell out everything—every achievement, every real victory—just to claim something fake? Project MoonShine?

▄▋▄▍▀:
Real victories are fleeting, ▙█▊▔▎ ░. And they’re meaningless without control. The world doesn’t care about the truth; it cares about who’s in charge.

▙█▊▔▎ ░:
And what’s left of you when you’ve manipulated your way to the top? A hollow shell. You’re a coward, ▄▋▄▍▀. The real world will crush you under the weight of your own lies.

▄▋▄▍▀:
You keep spouting your ideals, ▙█▊▔▎ ░. But deep down, you’re just as scared of me as the rest. You think you’re better than me? You’re nothing but a dying breed, clinging to a past that doesn’t exist anymore.

▙█▊▔▎ ░:
I’ll die with my integrity intact, at least. You’ll burn with nothing but the ashes of your false empire. I’d rather be a man of substance than a woman of nothing.

▄▋▄▍▀:
Don’t make me laugh. I’ll bury you, ▙█▊▔▎ ░. And everything you hold dear, I'll make sure of that.
