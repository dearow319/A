░ ▄ ▄ ▃,

I know you have been showing our messages to ▙ █ ▊ ▔ ▎  ░. I understand why you feel the need to do this, but I also know that you are not entirely convinced by his methods. Trust is a two-way street, and I am willing to build that trust with you.

I want you to know that I’ve been fully aware of your actions, and everything has been part of my plan. I instructed you to show these messages to ▙ █ ▊ ▔ ▎ ░ to gain his trust. However, now I need you to take it a step further. Show him this message, but do not reveal the next one—the one outlining our plans to take his life

This will prove your loyalty to me without compromising your position with ▙ █ ▊ ▔ ▎  ░.
