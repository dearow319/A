> The access Command
---
The access command is a critical security feature of the system. It is the only way to access files in the secret directory. To open a file, you must know the exact name it was saved under, ensuring that unauthorized users cannot casually browse sensitive data.

By requiring specific knowledge of file names, the access command minimizes the risk of accidental or unauthorized discovery of files within the XCORE.

Syntax:
	
access <filename> #Opens up secret file

Keypoints:

- No file browsing: There is no way to browse or list files in the secret directory; knowledge of the file name is the only way to access data.

- Protects sensitive files: Prevents unauthorized access, ensuring that only those with specific knowledge can retrieve files or delete them.

- The more randomised the file name, the more buried it is
