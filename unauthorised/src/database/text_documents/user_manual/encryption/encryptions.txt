> Encryptions in the XCORE System
---
Greetings, Operative.

The XCORE employs sophisticated encryption techniques to secure sensitive data, ensuring that only the most skilled individuals can decipher its secrets. 

Here’s an overview of the key encryption methods:

- Caesar Cipher: A substitution cipher shifting letters by a fixed number of positions.

- Transposition Cipher: This method rearranges the letters of a message based on a specific system or key, preserving the original characters but disguising the data’s structure.

- Vigenère Cipher: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to encode messages.

Guidelines for Use:
- Select the appropriate cipher based on mission sensitivity.

- Regularly rotate keys and keywords to maintain security.

- Never disclose encryption methods or keys to unauthorized personnel.

Master these encryptions as soon as possible.
