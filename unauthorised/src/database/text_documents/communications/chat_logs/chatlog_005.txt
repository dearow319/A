?: You don't know me, but I know you. Your leader’s methods are dangerous. He won't hesitate to kill you if you serve no use to him, trust me, I’ve seen the darkness firsthand.

You: I appreciate your concern, but I’m committed to my role.

?: What exactly is your role?

You: I'm sorry, I can't disclose that

?: Did he ever tell you about me? About a 'best friend' of his?

You: No?

?: Then I guess he still keeps the 'intruder' file a secret huh?
