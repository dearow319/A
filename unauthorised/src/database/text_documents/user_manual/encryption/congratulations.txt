Congratulations, Operative! You have proven your worth by successfully accessing this file. Only the most intelligent minds are welcomed into the ranks of The Order, and you have certainly earned your place among them. Well done.

Now, let me let you in on a little secret. Had you failed to open this file within three days, you might have... well, let’s just say you’d have mysteriously vanished from the face of the earth. Just a little motivation for the next time, eh?

But don’t get too comfortable. Unlike this little hand-holding exercise from me, other members of The Order won’t spoon-feed you passwords to their files. In The Order, passwords are often hidden between the lines, woven into the fabric of our words and works. Only those sharp enough to see will ever gain access.

Stay vigilant, Operative. Keep your wits sharp, your eyes peeled, and your curiosity endless.

Welcome to The Order.
