> A Note from the Developer
---
Well, well, well... you found this, didn’t you? I suppose that means you’ve been digging deeper than most, or maybe you just got lucky. Either way, congrats. You’ve unlocked the secret credit file.

Here’s the deal: the game is unfinished. Yep, that’s right. This little project of mine was rushed. I had plans which were too big for the chaotic 2 weeks I could only manage to put in the project.

If enough of you show love for this game, I might just come back to finish it. Heck, I might even go wild and release a sequel.

So, if you want to see more, let me know. Spread the word, share your thoughts, or just scream into the void and hope I’m listening. Your interest might just be the spark that brings this game to life.

And hey, it’s wild out here, and every bit of support counts. If you’re feeling generous, consider [url=https://buymeacoffee.com/redindiegames]buying me a coffee![/url]
