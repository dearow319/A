> Introduction to the Note Command
---
Hello, Operative.

Due to popular demand, the note command has been added to improve workflow.
The 'note' command temporarily stores a string (up to 128 characters) in memory for quick access.

Syntax:
	
note <text> #Store a note
note #View the currently stored note

Limitations:

- The note is temporary and won't persist after a session ends.
- Maximum length: 128 characters.
- Storing a new note overwrites the previous one.

Possible Use Cases:

- Quick reminders for tasks or info during a session.
- Session notes for troubleshooting or monitoring.
