The primary objective of the Black Door Project is to develop superhuman soldiers capable of withstanding extreme physical and psychological stress. These soldiers are intended to serve as elite operatives, capable of executing high-risk missions and neutralizing key targets, including high-profile individuals such as ▄▋▄▍▀. The project builds upon the findings of Nazi research discovered after World War II, aiming to refine and advance these techniques to create a new breed of human.

The methods employed in the Black Door Project are extensive and multifaceted, involving both physical and psychological experimentation. The process is divided into several phases, each designed to push the limits of human endurance and adaptability.
