> INTRUSION DISCOVERY
---
It seems your grip on the Vektorian sect is slipping and you're going soft. This report details the discovery of an infiltrator within your inner circle—plotting to splinter your precious little group. I’ve already handled it, of course, since you were preoccupied with plotting my assassination in Berlin.

You like to imagine yourself omnipotent, don’t you? And yet here I am, cleaning up your mess.

Background:
A foreign agent, disguised as a loyal Vektorian, had the audacity to infiltrate the sect. Their objective? To leverage our resources and sow discord for their own country's gain. How quaint.

Details of Intrusion:

- Identity: [REDACTED]

Their Objectives:

Let me guess—you had no idea? Typical. Find attached the 'agent_plan' and 'actions' I took
